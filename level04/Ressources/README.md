-rwsr-s-r-x 1 flag04 level04 152 Mar 5 2016 level04.pl <br/>
Again this setuid, that means this program can executes commands as flag04.

`cat level04.pl` <br/>
We can see 2 things: <br/>
1 - the print with \`\`,  backticks are used to run commands ! https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html<br/>
2 - We can see that localhost:4747 is used, as well as CGI. 

`CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface, it’s a protocol for executing scripts via web requests, and in the late 1990’s was the main way to write dynamic programs for the Web. It’s also the name of the Perl module we used [...] to code for the web.` <br/>

Open a web browser, connect to http://10.0.2.15:4747/

`The first way to pass data is with the query string, (the portion of a URI beginning with ?), which you see in URLs like https://example.com/?foo=bar. This uses the “GET” request method, and becomes available to the program as $ENV->{QUERY_STRING}, which in this case is foo=bar (CGI programs receive their arguments as environment variables).`<br/>
