` x  --> Holding place for the user’s “encrypted password.” Traditionally, this field actually stored the user’s encrypted password. Modern Unix systems store encrypted passwords in a separate file (the shadow password file) that can be accessed only by privileged users.`

Flag01 password is in clear but is encrypted same ways as `level00`'s `john` file. However Caesar cipher doesn't seem to find anything.

Let's install `john the ripper` on a personal computer, then use it on the password.
```bash
bash-3.2$ echo '42hDRfypTqqnw' > etc_passwd
bash-3.2$ john etc_passwd
Loaded 1 password hash (descrypt, traditional crypt(3) [DES 128/128 SSE2])
