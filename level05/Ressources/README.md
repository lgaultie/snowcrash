`ls` returns nothing

`find / -user flag05 2>/dev/null` </br>
finds: </br>
`/usr/sbin/openarenaserver` </br>
`/rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver`

`cd /usr/sbin && ls -l openarenaserver` </br>
gives: </br>
`-rwxr-x---+ 1 flag05 flag05 94 Mar  5  2016 openarenaserver`

The file has ACLs extended permissions. We can do `getfacl openarenaserver` to see them.</br>
Doesn't seems to be helpful here.

`cat openarenaserver` </br>
For each file in `/opt/openarenaserver/` it will execute it then supress it.

We can't execute `openarenaserver` however the files I created to test stuff in `/opt/openarenaserver/` disappeared after a while, `openarenaserver` seems to be launched by a cronjob or something.

Creating a file with `echo "getflag" > /opt/openarenaserver/getflag` and waiting for the program to be launch didn't do anything. Maybe redirect the output somewhere can work.

`"getflag > /tmp/prout" > /opt/openarenaserver/getflag` then `cat /tmp/prout` did the trick
